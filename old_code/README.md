## Handling Config

The environment variable `CHANAKYA_ENV` needs to be set pointing to the location of the config file relative to the `app/` directory.

For example, your config file is stored in `config/testing_and_dev.py` the value of your `CHANAKYA_ENV` variable would be `../config/testing_and_dev.py`. Before running the app flask will automatically load the config from the given environment variable and set the relevant config values.

You can use `config/local.py` as your file name. It is also added in the `.gitignore`

### Running app

flask run -p 8000

## To create Question run client.py - make sure you know what you are doing

- keep the server running and open a new terminal
- go to chanakya folder
- source venv/bin/activate
- python client.py rajeev
