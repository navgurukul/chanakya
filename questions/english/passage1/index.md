## Dangers threaten the big cats
Tigers rule! With their sharp claws and powerful bodies, the mighty cats run the jungle. However, the ferocious, or fierce, felines may not be large and in charge for long.
Wild tigers could soon become extinct, according to experts. Today there are only about 3,200 of the cats left in the wild. That’s a big change from 100 years ago, when there were an estimated 100,000 tigers.
“Wild tigers, outside of a few well-protected (locations), are disappearing fast,” Barney Long of the World Wildlife Fund told WR News. “This is something humans (really) care about.”

## Born to Be Wild
Tigers live in forests and jungles across Asia. Some of the countries where the big cats make their home include China, India, and Thailand. Siberian tigers can be found in the snowy forests of eastern Russia.
However, tigers today occupy only 7 percent of their past range, or area in which a species can survive. That’s about 40 percent less area than the felines lived in 10 years ago.
Nine types of tigers once roamed in the wild, but today just five species remain. The Bali, Caspian, and Javan tigers became extinct between the late 1930s and the early 1970s. Another species, the South China tiger, hasn’t been seen in the wild for 25 years.
“[Saving the] tigers is a very important issue for all of us,” explains Suwit Khunkitti. He is an environmental official from Thailand.

## Double Trouble
The big cats are being wiped out by two major threats: habitat loss and poaching, or illegal hunting. In Russia, loggers are cutting down trees to make paper. Less forest means less room for tigers to search for food.
In Indonesia and Malaysia, both countries in Asia, loggers are chopping down the jungles where tigers live to collect palm oil from plants. The oil is used in products such as ice cream, lipstick, and laundry detergent.
In China, poachers prowl the forests and national parks on the hunt for wild tigers. The cats’ fur and meat are in high demand in the Asian 
country. Even the felines’ bones are valuable. They are used as ingredients in some traditional Chinese medicines.


## Hunting for Help
Officials are ready to pounce on the tiger problem. Recently, world leaders met to discuss the felines’ future. Together with wildlife protection groups across the world, the leaders pledged to double the number of wild tigers within the next 12 years.
To do that, the leaders are putting together a plan to help save the animals. One of their first moves is to make people more aware of the dangers the cats face. Officials also plan to outsmart poachers by creating a system to keep the hunters from entering national wildlife parks.

Other leaders will work to reduce the demand for tigers’ fur and bones, says Long. His organization is working with a college in China to 
stop the use of tiger bones in medicine
If officials achieve their goals, the tiger population may thrive, or grow successfully, once again. “If we can solve these problems, the future is very, very bright [for the cats],” Long says.


## Tiger Trivia

Each cat’s stripes are unique, like human fingerprints. No two tigers have the same pattern.

## Ready to Pounce
Watch out, jungle animals! Tigers are skilled at stalking their prey. They can run up to 60 miles per hour.

Don’t let their size fool you. Even adult tigers sleep like babies. They nap up to 18 hours a day.


## Tiger Tracks
Wild tigers live in 14 countries today, but they once roamed across Asia and eastern Europe.
This map shows where the tigers can be found today compared with the region they used to roam.
